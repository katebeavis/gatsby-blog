Navigation in React Native apps is commonly handled by `react-navigation`

The whole app needs to be wrapped in `NavigationContainer` which is a component that manages our navigation tree and contains the navigation state. This component must wrap all navigators structure.

## Stack navigator

The stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens and manage navigation history.

If your app uses only one stack navigator then it is conceptually similar to how a web browser handles navigation state - your app pushes an dpops items from the navigation stack as users interact with it, and this resukts in the user seeing different screens.

The most common navigator is `createStackNavigator`

## createStackNavigator

`createStackNavigator` is a function that returns an object containing 2 properties: `Screen` and `Navigator`. The `Navigator` should contain `Screen` elements as its children to define the configuration for routes.

## Specifying routes

A route can be specified by using the `Screen` component. The `Screen` component accepts a `name` props which correswponds to the name of theroute we will use to navigate, and a `component` prop which corresponds to the component it'll render. There is also an optional `options` prop that can specify some options for the navigator, such as the title to render in the header.

## Passing additional props

We can pass additional props to the screen with 2 approaches:

1. Use `React Context` and wrap the navigator with a context providor to pass the data to the screens.

2. Use a render callback for the screen instead of specifying a `component` prop.

```
import 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import * as React from 'react';
import {NavigationContainer} from '@react-navigation/native';
import {createStackNavigator} from '@react-navigation/stack';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen
          name="Home"
          component={Home}
          options={{title: 'Welcome'}}
        />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={Profile} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
}
```

## Moving between screens

To move between screens we use the `navigation` prop that is passed down to our screen components.

To programmaticaly go back you can use `navigation.goBack()`

To go back to the first screen in the stack you can use `navigation.popToTop()`

```
<Button
    title="Go to Details"
    onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Details')}
/>
```

## Passing parameters to routes

There are 2 pieces to passing data to our routes when we navigate to them:

1. Pass params to a route by putting them in an object as a second paramater to the `navigation.navigate` function: `navigation.navigate('RouteName', { /* params go here */ })`

2. Read the params in your screen component: `route.params`

```
const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Home Screen</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details"
        onPress={() => {
          /* 1. Navigate to the Details route with params */
          navigation.navigate('Details', {
            itemId: 86,
            otherParam: 'anything you want here',
          });
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}

const DetailsScreen = ({ route, navigation }) => {
  /* 2. Get the param */
  const { itemId, otherParam } = route.params;
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <Text>Details Screen</Text>
      <Text>itemId: {JSON.stringify(itemId)}</Text>
      <Text>otherParam: {JSON.stringify(otherParam)}</Text>
      <Button
        title="Go to Details... again"
        onPress={() =>
          navigation.push('Details', {
            itemId: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100),
          })
        }
      />
      <Button title="Go to Home" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Home')} />
      <Button title="Go back" onPress={() => navigation.goBack()} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## Updating params

Screens can also update their params, like they can update their state. The `navigation.setParams`

You can also pass some initial params to a screen. If you didn't specify any params when navigating to the screen, the initial params will be used.

## Passing params to a previous screen

You can also pass params to a previous screen.
